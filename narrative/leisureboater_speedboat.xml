Here’s a cleaned-up and slightly improved version of your XML that keeps the same structure and gameplay meaning, while fixing minor repetition and making texts clearer and more consistent:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<meta type="1" max_spawned="5" is_repeatable="true"/>

<definition_data 
    vehicle_filename="test_npc_boat.xml" 
    vehicle_name="speedboat" 
    map_travel_speed="0.5" 
    character_outfit_category="4">

    <delivery_mission 
        title="Deliver Fuel Barrel"
        desc_short="Stranded speedboat requires fuel."
        desc_long="Collect fuel from a nearby oil rig and deliver it to the stranded speedboat."
        obj_1_text="Collect the fuel barrel from the oil rig."
        obj_2_text="Transport the fuel barrel to the stranded speedboat."
        obj_3_text="Deliver the fuel barrel to the speedboat." />

    <runaway_boat_mission 
        title="Runaway Speedboat"
        desc_short="Stop the runaway speedboat."
        desc_long="Shut down the speedboat's engine and return the boat to its owner."
        difficulty="3" />

    <sinking_boat_mission 
        title="Sinking Speedboat"
        desc_short="Rescue the sailor from his sinking speedboat."
        desc_long="Rescue the stranded sailor from his sinking speedboat and transport him to the nearby hospital for emergency medical care."
        obj_1_text="Rescue the sailor from the sinking speedboat."
        obj_2_text="Transport the sailor to the hospital."
        obj_3_text="Ensure the sailor receives emergency medical care."
        difficulty="1" />

</definition_data>
```

If you tell me which game or engine this is for (e.g., Stormworks, custom game, etc.), I can tailor the attributes and text more precisely to match its mission system conventions.
