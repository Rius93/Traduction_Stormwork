This XML defines configuration for an NPC speedboat and three mission types associated with it:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<meta type="1" max_spawned="5" is_repeatable="true"/>

<definition_data 
    vehicle_filename="test_npc_boat.xml" 
    vehicle_name="speedboat" 
    map_travel_speed="0.5" 
    character_outfit_category="4">

    <delivery_mission 
        desc_long="Collect fuel from a nearby oil rig and deliver to the stranded speedboat." 
        desc_short="Stranded speedboat requires fuel." 
        title="Deliver fuel barrel" 
        obj_1_text="Deliver fuel barrel" 
        obj_2_text="Deliver fuel barrel" 
        obj_3_text="Deliver fuel barrel"/>

    <runaway_boat_mission 
        desc_long="Shut the speedboat's engine down and deliver it back to its owner." 
        desc_short="Stop the runaway speedboat." 
        title="Runaway Speedboat" 
        difficulty="3"/>

    <sinking_boat_mission 
        desc_long="Rescue the stranded sailor and transport him to the nearby hospital for emergency medical care." 
        desc_short="Rescue the sailor from his sinking speedboat." 
        title="Sinking Speedboat" 
        obj_1_text="Rescue sailor" 
        obj_2_text="Rescue sailor" 
        obj_3_text="Rescue sailor" 
        difficulty="1"/>
</definition_data>
```

Summary of elements:

- `<meta>`:  
  - `type="1"` – some internal classification.  
  - `max_spawned="5"` – up to 5 instances can exist simultaneously.  
  - `is_repeatable="true"` – missions/events using this can repeat.

- `<definition_data>`:  
  - `vehicle_filename="test_npc_boat.xml"` – file for the boat’s actual vehicle definition.  
  - `vehicle_name="speedboat"` – in‑game name/identifier.  
  - `map_travel_speed="0.5"` – how fast it travels on the world map.  
  - `character_outfit_category="4"` – outfit group for its crew/NPC.

- `<delivery_mission>`: fuel delivery objective for a stranded speedboat; all three objective texts are identical (“Deliver fuel barrel”).

- `<runaway_boat_mission>`: stop a runaway boat and return it; includes `difficulty="3"`.

- `<sinking_boat_mission>`: rescue a sailor from a sinking boat and bring them to a hospital; three identical rescue objective texts; `difficulty="1"` (easier than the runaway mission).

If you tell me what system or game this is for and what you want to change (e.g., difficulty, texts, more objectives, more mission types), I can rewrite or extend the XML accordingly.
